# FiveInARow
A side project written in Java.
A program for playing Five In A row game and has a robot side.
The rule of the game: 
1. There are two players in total (the robot and the human user) and all the information are open and shared by both sides in the game.
2. The first one to have five points of his or her side connected unbroken in a (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) line wins the game. 
3. The game is played on a 15x15 board.

Note:
Since the project is still under development and the front-end is not completed yet, user can only play in the console through looking at the printed board (where 1 represents a point of user1, 2 represents a point of user2 and 0 represents a position that is still empty) and entering the coordinate of next step. Also, I am working on improving the efficiency of the program.
